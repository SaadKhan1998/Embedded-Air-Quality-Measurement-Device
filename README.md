# Embedded-Air-Quality-Measurement-Device
This project implements an embedded system to monitor AQI, collecting real-time data (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10, temperature, humidity) using sensors. The data is sent to ThingSpeak for cloud storage and visualization. AQI is computed with EPA thresholds and displayed on LED matrix and seven-segment displays, with FIFO buffering for historical data.
